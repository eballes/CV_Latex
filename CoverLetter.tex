I am passionate about the space industry and the software development
process. As software engineer, I have worked in the space sector deepening

testing roles, including integration tasks, to managing requirements and 
writing software integration plans for system components.

From my education I have learned to develop effective, flexible and adaptable software,

well-rounded understanding of the challenges that are faced between different companies 
and in multicultural teams inside the European space industry. I would bring
to your team my enthusiasm for software quality and control, pragmatic problem
solving skills and a drive to always produce the best quality of work for your
company.
